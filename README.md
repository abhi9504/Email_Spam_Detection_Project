# Email_Spam_Detection_Project Description:

The Email Spam Detection project uses machine learning and feature engineering (like TF-IDF) to classify emails as spam or ham. By applying algorithms like Naive Bayes, the system effectively filters spam, improving email security and reducing unwanted messages. Future improvements could involve using larger datasets and deep learning for better accuracy.
